# ME315_Heat_Transfer_Lab_Project
Develop a MatLab code to solve for the temperature distribution using the finite volume method 

This project seeks to introduce or expand the student's ability to describe, model, and solve heat transfer problems 
that are more complex than analytical solution techniques permit. 
The project requires the development of a partial differential equation and associated boundary conditions. 
The PDE must then be transformed into a series of algebraic equations by a process known as "discretization". 
These algebraic equations, which constitute a system of linear equations, must then be solved by a suitable technique 
for the solution of a matrix equation. 
In this course, the finite volume method will be used to derive the discretized equations and an iterative technique 
will be used to solve the equations. 
These techniques are common to many commercial heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics software, such as ANSYS: Fluent. 
As a result of completing this project, the students can expect to have a better understanding 
of how complex heat transfer problems are formulated and solved in addition to strengthening programming skills 
and knowledge of numerical methods.
